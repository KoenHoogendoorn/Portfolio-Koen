Hi, I’m Koen and I love designing and developing digital products. Currently I’m based in Utrecht and I’ve been creating digital products for 9 years. Professional contacts describe me as a team player, hard worker and generally positive person.

During my studies towards a bachelor's in Communication and Multimedia Design at the Hogeschool of Amsterdam, I interned at
[Tag the Love](https://www.tagthelove.com/) and [Unc Inc](https://www.uncinc.nl/en). After the internship at Tag the Love finished, I continued working here alongside my educational programme. After graduating, I started working here fulltime. Here I worked on personal websites for people with different styles. I learned a lot from working on a bunch of different projects.

Next, I [worked at Kinder](http://koenhoogendoorn.nl/kinder). Helping charities do better, it was great to work at a company that wants to make the world a better place. It was a nice change of pace to experience working on a single project for a longer time. Although it encompassed multiple products, the overall mission and brand was the same.

After moving to Utrecht, I started at [xel](https://www.xel.nl/) (with a lowercase x!). Here I designed new features for existing tools and worked out the user experience for new projects. I developed concepts with which we could help users create a new website through an app. I was also the point of contact for all UX related issues for all developers.

In my time off, I like playing guitar, cycling, reading and gamenights with friends. Being a bit of a fantasy nerd, I love playing and talking about [Dungeons and Dragons](http://koenhoogendoorn.nl/dragons-quill).

So if you would like to work together or talk about dragons, don't hesitate to contact me!
