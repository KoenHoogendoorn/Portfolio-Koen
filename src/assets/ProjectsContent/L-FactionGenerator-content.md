### About Faction Generator

This is a tool I made to help me be a better Dungeon Master (read more about what that means [here](http://www.koenhoogendoorn.nl/dragon's-quill)).

One of my favorite things of being a Dungeon Master is creating a world for my friends to play in. There are a bunch of generators online that help spark inspiration during worldbuilding. This is one that I still use quite often.

### Problem

Factions are great to make your campaign world feel real. These groups of people have goals of their own. When trying to achieve them, they can set things surrounding your player characters in motion. If the players don’t take action, the world could change for the better or worse.

While preparing factions adventures and campaigns, it can be hard to think outside of the box. I often fall into classic tropes. A group of robed cultists are tyring to resurrect an evil god. A hidden elven village that protect the forest. Great options for your first campaign, but after a while you want to spice things up!

### Solution

With this faction generator you will never have to flesh out a faction again. It will name all NPC’s, spit out a map of their lair and create custom artwork of their symbol. It also solves world hunger and cures all diseases.

Ok, maybe it doesn’t do all those. It gives you an idea for a faction. It should actually be called faction idea generator, but that doesn’t roll of the tongue quite as nicely.

Because it generates an abstract idea, it is easier to fit in your world. A table full of stats often gets me into the ‘editing’ mode. What parts do I like, what do I have to change to make this work in my world.

I’d rather be in the ‘creating’ mode. What do these pirates want? Why are they following a book? What’s in the book? WHAT’S IN THE BOOK!?

### My role

I designed and developed this website.
