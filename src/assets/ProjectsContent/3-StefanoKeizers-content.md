### About Stefano

What Stefano does is hard to catch in words. A lot of people either love or hate him for his TV appearances and comedy shows. For his site, he wanted to focus on his absurdistic one man shows.

### Problem

The website for Stefano’s show had to be an online representation of his unique spirit, but still be easy to use. Focussing on his show, the most important thing was to make sure people could easily find the dates and locations he was performing and buy tickets. He also wanted to be able to add links to media items about him and products he was selling.

### Solution

After talking with Stefano about what he wanted out of his website, I came up with some ideas and sketched them out. A few iterations later we came to a design that used his expressive photo’s as the base for his site. By visually showing body parts on top of eachother, starting with his upperbody and going lower with each element, it creates a strange, almost naked representation of him. This fit well with his show that he wanted to promote. After his first show ended, he liked the visual elements so much that he continued the style for his next shows, up until the most recent one in 2021.

After looking at websites of competitors, I saw it was best practice to have a big button at the top of your site with ‘Tour dates’, linking to a page with all of them in a simple list. This fitted well in the designs, so I added a button and page like this.

### My role

In this project I was the project manager and overall designer. Together with another developer we brought my ideas to life.
