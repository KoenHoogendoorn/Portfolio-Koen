### Problem

Jelle and Marcel needed some help with selling their concept to potential clients. They are both very creative and funny, but needed some help balancing this to come across more professional.

### Solution

First, I talked with the duo about the people who actually hire them. They talked to them and know what kind of information they are looking for.

They already made a video introducing themselves and their service. It gives all the essential information of their service. Because it is well produced and it shows off their charismatic personalities, it is displayed directly beneath the title to quickly retain the attention of visitors. Testimonials are placed below the video, just like comments on YouTube. They give people with a short attention span something to read, and each emphasize a specific USP for the duo.

Together with Jelle and Marcel, we wrote copy that tells all the facts that their potential clients need to make a decision. This is what all texts on the page are focused on.

After the video, the main features of their service are displayed.  
Following these features, visitors will see a ‘how it works’ section to lower the threshold of contacting. This is followed by a simple contact form.

### My role

I designed the website and used Webflow to develop it.
